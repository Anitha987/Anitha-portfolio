 <div id="About">
  <h1>Education background</h1>
  <p>As i've introduced before my names are <strong>Anitha Umuhire</strong> and am a beginner in programming.</p>
  <p>in my advanced level i did not take computer as my course cause i was interested 
      in biology,maths and chemistry.</p>
  <p>So after knowing that there are these trainings that are taking place at KIE i wished i would join 
      and luckly i got that opportunity and now am enjoying the coding staff though challenging 
      sometimes but i will make it.</p>
